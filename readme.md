# Coloured Blocks With Faces Game

This will be a simple Android based clone of Hues (itself a 2048 variant). Hues disappeared off the Play store several years ago and people I like enough to want to keep happy have noted that they miss it. I'm remaking in it in Godot (using C#) to make them happy.

The original had three modes:
* limited moves
* limited time
* unlimited play

Unlimited play was a paid feature in the original. It is the only mode I'll be incorporating in this version.

Once complete, an APK of the game will be available via itch.io for free. Linux and Windows builds are a possibility down the line, but not the primary goal.
